Implementation:
* You should not over-thinking on what need to be implemented, only focus on what need to be done.
* If you have uncertainity, just Ask before implement.
* You can consider asking more questions to confirm scope before implementing things.


Documents:
* No need to add implementation, debug and test guide document after implementation.
* Any test related files should not be persisted.
